# weather_with_you

### PURPOSE

The purpose of this application is to provide the user basic weather information (temperature, humidity, UV Index, wind speed) for any given city.

### REQUIREMENTS

The app is required to provide a search window, clickable button. Once the search is executed, the current weather appears in the main card, with the name of the city appearing above it. The next five days' forecasts are provided below. The application also needs to retain a list of previous searches, which should be clickable, thus executing the search again. 

##### Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of the application.

### DIFFICULTIES

There were many complex functions that needed to come together into one application, including the addition of two APIs and ajax calls. There were certain functions I was not able to complete, but look forward to completing them at a later date. These include providing the date of each forecasted day, a full list of searched cities (and making them all clickable items), and providing a color code for the UV Index.

### LESSONS (TAKEN FROM PREVIOUS PROJECT)

I have learned, the hard way, to think about projects, plan them, pseudocode them before beginning to actually write code. It is VERY easy to get turned around and inside out when you don't write your code in an orderly fashion.
